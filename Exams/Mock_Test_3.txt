In this exercise, you'll create a directory for your user and ensure that proper permissions are set.


A. First, create the following directory: /opt/bob/

B. Make user bob the owner of this directory. The group owner should remain unchanged.

C. On the /opt/bob/ directory remove all permissions for the group and for other users. 
   Your user, bob should have rwx permissions but all permissions for group and others should be denied.


D. After performing these actions, what is the octal permission number for /opt/bob/ directory ? 
   For example a directory with these permissions: drwxr-xr-x is equivalent to 755 permissions in octal. 
   Write the octal permission number for /opt/bob directory to this file: /opt/octal.txt



A:
--
1)  $  sudo mkdir /opt/bob
2)  $  ls -l /opt/

total 104
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root     6 Oct  2 13:08 bob


3)  $  sudo chown bob /opt/bob
4)  $  ls -l /opt/

total 104
drwxr-xr-x. 2 bob  root     6 Oct  2 13:08 bob


5)  $  sudo chmod u=rwx,g=,o= /opt/bob/
6)  $  stat /opt/bob

Q (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!):
----------------------------------------
In your home directory you will find some text files. Perform the following actions on these


A. First, look for reversed.txt. The text inside makes no sense when you read from top to bottom. 
   But there is a command that lets you read a file backwards, from bottom to top. Use that command to display this file and redirect the reversed output to /opt/corrected.txt


B. Look for a file called shuffled.txt. You will find 200 lines Inside it, in a random order. Do not change the contents of this file throughout this exercise. 
   There are lines that contain the word line followed by a number between 00 and 99, and some lines that contain the word LINE followed by a number between 00 and 99.
   Filter out only the lines written in CAPITAL LETTERS, containing the word LINE. 
   Then sort this filtered output so that these lines appear in their natural order, from LINE00, LINE01, LINE02, all the way to LINE99. 
   Save this filtered and sorted output to this file: /opt/sortedLINES.txt


C. Extract the first 50 lines from shuffled.txt and save them to /opt/first50.txt

D. Extract the last 50 lines from shuffled.txt and save them to /opt/last50.txt

E. From shuffled.txt extract only the lines that end with the number 3. Example output you might see:

line13
LINE23

Save this filtered output to /opt/filtered.txt


Also, remember to log back to the user bob.



A:
--
1)  $  sudo -i
2)  $  sudo tac /home/bob/reversed.txt >> /opt/corrected.txt
3)  $  sudo grep 'LINE' /home/bob/shuffled.txt | sort >> /opt/sortedLINES.txt
4)  $  sudo head -n 50 /home/bob/shuffled.txt >> /opt/first50.txt
5)  $  sudo tail -n 50 /home/bob/shuffled.txt >> /opt/last50.txt
6)  $  sudo grep '3\>' /home/bob/shuffled.txt >> /opt/filtered.txt

Q (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!):
------------------------------------------------
In this exercise, you will work with some archives.


A. First, archive the /home/bob/databases/ directory. Save this archive to this file: /opt/archive.tar.bz2 .
The tar tf /opt/archive.tar.bz2 command should show home/bob/databases/ as the base directory for the files stored in this archive. Here is an example:

home/bob/databases/
home/bob/databases/file.sql
home/bob/databases/data.txt
home/bob/databases/file


B. Archive the databases directory again. But this time, do it differently. First of all, save the archive at /opt/archive2.tar.gz.
This time the tar tf /opt/archive2.tar.gz command should show bob/databases/ as the base directory instead of home/bob/databases/. Here's an example :

bob/databases/
bob/databases/file.sql
bob/databases/data.txt
bob/databases/file


C. In your home directory, you will find an archive in the backup.tar.gz file. Extract the contents of this archive in /opt/restored/ directory.



A:
--
1)  $  sudo tar -cjvf /opt/archive.tar.bz2 /home/bob/databases/
2)  $  # sudo tar -czvf /opt/archive2.tar.gz /home/bob/databases/
      
       cd /home
       sudo tar -czvf /opt/archive2.tar.gz bob/databases/

B. Make sure that only errors with a debug severity and higher are collected to that error logs.



A:
--
# Change "ErrorLog" and "LogLevel"
1)  $  sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

#
# ErrorLog: The location of the error log file.
# If you do not specify an ErrorLog directive within a <VirtualHost>
# container, error messages relating to that virtual host will be
# logged here.  If you *do* define an error logfile for a <VirtualHost>
# container, that host's errors will be logged there and not here.
#
# ErrorLog "logs/error_log"
ErrorLog "/var/log/httpd/httpd_errors.log"

#
# LogLevel: Control the number of messages logged to the error_log.
# Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,
# alert, emerg.
#
# LogLevel warn
LogLevel debug

  
2)  $ sudo systemctl restart httpd

A. Currently, only the root user can add files to the /var/www/ directory. 
   Add the proper ACL permission so that user bob can also add files to this directory. 
   Of course, it should also be able to list directory contents and cd into the directory.


B. Someone accidentally added some ACL permissions to the /mnt/ directory. Clean that up and remove ALL ACL permissions from /mnt/



A:
--
1)  $  sudo setfacl -m u:bob:rwx /var/www/
2)  $  sudo setfacl -b /mnt/

Prepare the disk at /dev/vde for encryption:


A. Format it with LUKS. Choose the password ExamPassed

B. Open the encrypted device and map it to the virtual unencrypted device called examdrive

C. Create an xfs filesystem on this unencrypted mapped device, examdrive



A:
--
1)  $  sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/vde

WARNING!
========
This will overwrite data on /dev/vde irrevocably.

Are you sure? (Type 'yes' in capital letters): YES
Enter passphrase for /dev/vde: ExamPassed
Verify passphrase: ExamPassed


2)  $  sudo cryptsetup open /dev/vde examdrive
Enter passphrase for /dev/vde: ExamPassed

Create a mirrored (level 1) RAID array with these two devices: /dev/vdc and /dev/vdd.
The array should be created at /dev/md0.



A:
--
1)  $  sudo mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/vdc /dev/vdd

mdadm: Note: this array has metadata at the start and
    may not be suitable as a boot device.  If you plan to
    store '/boot' on this device please ensure that
    your boot-loader understands md/v1.x metadata, or use
    --metadata=0.90
Continue creating array? yes
mdadm: Defaulting to version 1.2 metadata
mdadm: array /dev/md0 started.

Change the disk quota for the group called nginx. Limit the inodes that this group can create. 
Set a soft limit of 3500 inodes and a hard limit of 4000 inodes on /mnt partition.



A:

Make sure you're logged in as the user called bob and you perform this task using user bob only (without sudo). 
If you're currently logged in as root, exit from this user session and return to your main user session under bob.


A. Find all directories in the /home/bob/library/ directory. 
   This means files should not appear in the result list. Narrow your search to directories only. 
   Some directories are unreadable and will show up as errors (stderr) in this result list. 
   In your find command, redirect all error messages to this file /home/bob/errors.out.


B. Now, redirect all standard messages (non-errors, stdout) to /home/bob/standard.out


C. Perform the same search as above, but this time, redirect BOTH error messages and standard messages (stdout,stderr) to the same file: /home/bob/all.out 
   Basically, what you would see in your terminal if you would use the find command normally (without any redirects) is the exact content 
   you should have in /home/bob/all.out, with results, errors and standard output, appearing in the same order.



A:
--
# Save all errors
1)  $  find library/ -type d 2> errors.out
2)  $  cat  errors.out

find: ‘library/dir3848’: Permission denied


# Save stdout
3)  $  find library/ -type d > standard.out
4)  $  cat standard.out

library/dir9896


# Save both stderr and stdout
5)  $  find library/ -type d > all.out 2>&1
6)  $  cat all.out

find: ‘library/dir8868’: Permission denied
