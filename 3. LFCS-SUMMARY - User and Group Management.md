# LFCS Notes

## User and Group Management

###  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <ins>Create, delete, and modify local user accounts</ins>

Each person who needs to log in, must have their separate User account : this allows them to have their personal files and directories protected by proper permissions. They also get to chhose their own settings for whatever tools they use, and it also help us as administrators.

> We can limit the privileges of each user to only what they require to do their job. Thi can sometimes reduce or prevent the damage when someone accidentally writes the wrong command and it can help with the overall security of the system.

#### üîñ <ins>Create</ins>

##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <ins>**User account**</ins>

Let's say we want to create **john** user :

- a new User **john** is added to the system
- a new group **john** is automatically created, set as the primary group
- a home directory **/home/john** is created, where John can store his personal files, directories and program settings.
- the default shell will be the program found at **/bin/bash**
- All the files from  **/etc/skel** will be copied to `/home/john`

> https://www.it-connect.fr/le-repertoire-etcskel-sous-linux/?utm_content=cmp-true
>
> skel (aka skeleton) is a template for `home` directory : it defines the default profile for each new user.

```sh
# Command to create an User
$ sudo useradd john

$ ls -l /home/
drwx------. 15 cento cento 4096 Sep  2 03:45 cento
drwx------.  3 john  john    78 Sep  3 00:01 john

$ ls -a /etc/skel
.  ..  .bash_logout  .bash_profile  .bashrc  .mozilla


# Add an user with a specific User ID
$ sudo useradd --uid 1100 smith
```

All of these things happen because the OS is configured to take some default actions for each newly created account. We can explore these defaults with the following commands :

```sh
$ useradd --defaults

GROUP=100
HOME=/home
INACTIVE=-1
EXPIRE=
SHELL=/bin/bash
SKEL=/etc/skel
CREATE_MAIL_SPOOL=yes
```

Other defaults related to account creation can be seen by exploring this file.

```sh
$ cat /etc/login.defs

# *REQUIRED*
#   Directory where mailboxes reside, _or_ name of file, relative to the
#   home directory.  If you _do_ define both, MAIL_DIR takes precedence.
#   QMAIL_DIR is for Qmail
#
#QMAIL_DIR      Maildir
MAIL_DIR        /var/spool/mail
#MAIL_FILE      .mail
```

<br/>

To choose a different shell and home directory

```sh
$ sudo useradd --shell /bin/othershell --home-dir /home/otherdirectory/ john
$ sudo useradd -s /bin/othershell -d /home/otherdirectory/ john
```

<br/>

##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <ins>**Password**</ins>

To set a password

```sh
$ sudo passwd john

Changing password for user john.
New password:
Retype new password:
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.
```

The account details such as usernames, user IDs, group IDs, preferred shells, etc. can be found at **`/etc/passwd`**.

```sh
$ cat /etc/passwd

# john:x:<USER_ID>:<GROUP_ID>::<HOME_DIRECTORY>:<PREFERRED_SHELL>
john:x:1001:1001::/home/otherdirectory/:/bin/othershell
```

<br/>

##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <ins>**System Account**</ins>

These accounts are intended for <ins><span style="color:#FF8A8A">**programs**</span></ins>. Contrary to user accounts, they don't have a home directory.

- Usually Daemons use system accounts
- a database program is running under a system account
```sh
$ sudo useradd --system sysacc

# The numeric ID is maller than 1000
```

<br>

#### üîñ <ins>Delete</ins>

To delete an account and its group

```sh
$ sudo userdel john

# To also delete its home directory and mail spool
$ sudo userdel --remove john
$ sudo userdel -r john
```

<br>

#### üîñ <ins>Modify</ins>

Let's say we decide to recreate john account but we want to change some details.

```sh
$ ls -l /home
drwx------. 15 cento cento 4096 Sep  2 03:45 cento
drwx------.  3 john  john    78 Sep  3 01:15 john

# Modify home directory. --move-home ensures that old directory will be moved or renamed
$ sudo usermod --home /home/otherdirectory --move-home john
$ sudo usermod -d /home/otherdirectory -m john
$ ls -l /home
drwx------. 15 cento cento 4096 Sep  2 03:45 cento
drwx------.  3 john  john    78 Sep  3 01:15 otherdirectory
```
```sh
$ ls -l /home
drwx------. 15 cento cento 4096 Sep  2 03:45 cento
drwx------.  3 john  john    78 Sep  3 01:15 john

# Modify username
$ sudo usermod --login jane john 
$ sudo usermod -l jane john

# john user name has changed
$ ls -l /home
drwx------. 15 cento cento 4096 Sep  2 03:45 cento
drwx------.  3 jane  john    78 Sep  3 01:15 otherdirectory
```
```sh
$ cat /etc/passwd
jane:x:1001:1001::/home/otherdirectory:/bin/bash

# Modify shell
$ sudo usermod --shell /bin/othershell jane
$ sudo usermod -s /bin/othershell jane

$ cat /etc/passwd
jane:x:1001:1001::/home/otherdirectory:/bin/othershell
```

<br/>

To disable or enable again an account :

```sh
$ sudo usermod --lock jane 
$ sudo usermod -L jane

$ sudo usermod --unlock jane 
$ sudo usermod -U jane
```

To set an expiration date or no expiration date to an account :

```sh
# Date format: YEAR-MONTH-DAY
$ sudo usermod --expiredate 2021-12-10 jane 
$ sudo usermod -e 2021-12-10 jane

$ sudo usermod --expiredate "" jane 
$ sudo usermod -e "" jane
```

To set an expiration to a <ins><span style="color:#FF8A8A">**password**</span></ins> (chage for **ch**ange **age**):

```sh
# To set the password to expired immediately
$ sudo chage --lastday 0 jane 
$ sudo chage -d 0 jane

# To cancel previous action : unexpire the password
$ sudo chage --lastday -1 jane 
$ sudo chage -d -1 jane


# To make sure the user changes password every 30 days
$ sudo chage --maxdays 30 jane 
$ sudo chage -M 30 jane

# To make sure the password never expires
$ sudo chage --maxdays -1 jane 
$ sudo chage -M -1 jane
```

To see when account expires :

```sh
$ sudo chage --list jane
$ sudo chage -l jane

Last password change                                    : Sep 03, 2023
Password expires                                        : never
Password inactive                                       : never
Account expires                                         : never
Minimum number of days between password change          : 0
Maximum number of days between password change          : 99999
Number of days of warning before password expires       : 7
```
<br>

#### üîñ <ins>Other commands</ins>

```sh
$ id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) 
context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023

$ whoami
root
```

&nbsp;

###  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <ins>Create, delete, and modify local groups and group memberships</ins>

Each user can belong to one or more groups. Using groups is like assigning **roles** to user accounts for having access permissions to files or directories.

Groups can also have special effects. We have :

- <ins>The primary group (called **login group**) :</ins> 

  This is the group applied to you when you log in; in most user cases it has the same name as your login name. The primary group is used by default when creating new files (or directories), modifying files, or executing commands.

- <ins>The secondary group :</ins> 

    These are groups you are a member of beyond your primary group. As an example, this means that if a directory or file belongs to the www-data group (as used by the web server process in this case), then all www-data group members can read or modify these files directly (assuming the permissions also allow for this).

> https://www.hostingadvice.com/how-to/linux-add-user-to-group/
>
> User account can have several secondary groups but only one primary group.

<br/>

#### üîñ <ins>Create</ins>

##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <ins>**Group account**</ins>

```sh
$ sudo groupadd developers

# To add an User to this group
$ sudo gpasswd --add john developers
$ sudo gpasswd -a john developers

Adding user john to group developers


# To see in which groups the User belongs
# The first group after the : is the primary or login group
# What follows are the secondary or supplementary groups
$ groups john
john : john developers


# To remove from a group
$ sudo gpasswd --delete john developers
$ sudo gpasswd -d john developers

Removing user john from group developers
```

<br>

#### üîñ <ins>Modify</ins>
On rare occasions, we might want to change the primary group. We can do this with this command : 

```sh
# -g change the primary group
$ sudo usermod -g developers john
# -G change the secondary group
$ sudo usermod -G developers john


# We have added john to developers group : sudo gpasswd -a john developers
$ groups john
john : john developers

# To avoid confusion, we will use gID argument instead
$ sudo usermod --gid developers john

# Primary group is developers
$ groups john
john : developers
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING (note the difference here) :

- `gpasswd` : expects USERNAME then GROUP
- `usermod` : expects GROUP then USERNAME

<br/>

To rename a group, from developers to programmers :

```sh
$ groups john
john : developers

$ sudo groupmod --new-name programmers developers
$ sudo groupmod -n programmers developers

$ groups john
john : programmers
```

<br>

#### üîñ <ins>Delete</ins>

To delete a group :

```sh
$ sudo groupdel programmers
groupdel: cannot remove the primary group of user 'john'

# We have to change John's primary group to john group
$ sudo usermod --gid john john

$ sudo groupdel programmers
$ groups john
john : john
```

&nbsp;

###  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <ins>Manage system-wide environment profiles</ins>

We'll look at how to manage system wide environment profiles in Linux.

#### üîñ <ins>Setting environment variables</ins>

```sh
# To display current user's environment variables
$  printenv

XDG_SESSION_ID=1
HOSTNAME=localhost.localdomain
SELINUX_ROLE_REQUESTED=
TERM=xterm-256color
SHELL=/bin/bash
HISTSIZE=1000             # Maximum size of the commands history for a shell it should have
SSH_CLIENT=192.168.25.2 51001 22
SELINUX_USE_CURRENT_RANGE=
SSH_TTY=/dev/pts/0
USER=cento


$ echo $HOSTNAME
localhost.localdomain


# To edit variables
$ vi /home/$USER/.bashrc
```

<br/>

If we want to make sure that some variable are set to a certain value **for every user that logs on the system**, we can add them to the **`/etc/environment`** file.

```sh
$ su -
$ sudo vim /etc/environment
KODEKLOUD=https://kodekloud.com

$ ls -l /etc/
-rw-r--r--.  1 root root       32 Sep  4 02:34 environment

$ logout
$ echo $KODEKLOUD
$ logout
Connection to 127.0.0.1 closed

$ ssh cento@127.0.0.1
$ echo $KODEKLOUD
https://kodekloud.com
```

<br>

#### üîñ <ins>Scripts</ins>

What if we want to run a command every time a user logs in : we can use the special directory **`/etc/profile.d/`** to create a bash file.

```sh
$ sudo vim /etc/profile.d/lastlogin.sh

echo "Your last login was at: " > $HOME/lastlogin
date >> $HOME/lastlogin


$ logout
$ ls /home/cento/
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  lastlogin  Music  Pictures  Public  Templates  user.log  Videos

$ cat /home/cento/lastlogin
Your last login was at:
Mon Sep  4 03:25:45 PDT 2023
```

&nbsp;

###  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <ins>Manage template user environment</ins>

When creating a new User account, all files from **`/etc/skel/`** are copied to the new User's home directory.

Imagine that we want to inform all new users about some default policy : we will create a README file in skel directory.

```sh
$ sudo vim /etc/skel/README

Please don't run CPU-intensive 
processes between 8AM and 10PM.

# Let's create a new user 
$ sudo useradd trinity

# We can find that README was copied to /home/trinity
$ sudo ls -a /home/trinity
.  ..  .bash_logout  .bash_profile  .bashrc  .mozilla  README

$ cat /home/trinity/README
Please don't run CPU-intensive
processes between 8AM and 10PM.
```

What if we want to add environment variables for our new User ? We could edit his/her `.bashrc` file : his/her bash login shell will execute the instructions in this file every tim she logs in.

```sh
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/home/cento/.local/bin:/home/cento/bin


$ vim /home/cento/.bashrc

# PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin:$PATH"
# Our new entry to PATh is /opt/bin, preceded and followed by a colon : (the separator for each new entry)
# We have to make sure we add the entry before the $PATH
# By adding some extra applications in /opt/bin we can add this path variable for all users or for a specific user.
PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin:/opt/bin:$PATH"


$ logout
Connection to 127.0.0.1 closed.

$ echo $PATH
/home/cento/.local/bin:/home/cento/bin:/opt/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/home/cento/.local/bin:/home/cento/bin
```

&nbsp;

###  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <ins>Configure user resource limits</ins>

Lets's look at managing user resource limits and Linux.

When we have a lot of users logging into the system, we want to impose limits on  resources , by editing this file.

- In '**domain**' column:

  - We specify the username / @group / everyone (*) to impose limits
  - Limits on * will only apply to every user not mentioned int this list
  - A User's limit overrides an asterisk limit

<br/>

- In '**type**' column:

  - A **hard** limit can not be overridden by a regular user. It is the max value for a resource 
  - A **soft** limit, instead of a max value, is more like an initial value when the User lofgs in. The value can be raised to anything but never above the hard limit
  - The **-** sign specifies both a hard and soft limit.

<br/>

- In '**item**' column:

  - This decides what the limit is for : 
    - `data ` for maximum data size (KB) 
    - `nproc` for number of processes
    - `fsize` for maximum file size that can be created in the user session (KB)
    - `cpu` sets the limit for CPU time (minutes)
    - `memlock` for maximum locked-in-memory address space (KB) 
    - `nice` for maximum nice priority allowed to raise to (Linux 2.6.12 and higher) values: [-20,19] 

> https://serverfault.com/questions/487602/linux-etc-security-limits-conf-explanation

```sh
$ sudo vim /etc/security/limits.conf

#<domain>      <type>  <item>         <value>
#
#*               soft    core            0
#*               hard    rss             10000
#@student        hard    nproc           20
#@faculty        soft    nproc           20
#@faculty        hard    nproc           50
#ftp             hard    nproc           0
#@student        -       maxlogins       4


# Every users can use to 30 processes but trinity can only go to 10 processes
trinity          hard   nproc            10
@developers      soft   nproc            20
*                -      nproc            30

# trinity should be able to run 20 processes at the most. When she logs in, she should be able to use up to her entire allocation without needing to manually raise her limit.
trinity          -      nproc            20

# CPU time 1s represents 100% of CPU core use. If 50%, 0.5s.
# Here a CPU time limit of 1 minute would take 1 minute to be consumed if the process had 100% cpu utilization, but 2 minutes to consume if the process used 50% utilization.
trinity          hard   cpu              1
```

Lets' limit the number of processes to 3.

```sh
#<domain>      <type>  <item>         <value>
trinity            -   nproc            3

# Let's lauch ps and pipe output to the less pager : we have 3 running processes
$ ps | less
   PID TTY          TIME CMD
  4282 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
  4324 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
  4325 pts/0    00:00:00 less

# Let's try to run 4 mores processes : 'ls', 'grep', 'bash' and 'less'. it is failing as expected
$ ls -a | grep bash | less
-bash: fork: retry: Resource temporarily unavailable
-bash: fork: retry: Resource temporarily unavailable
```

<br/>

To display the limits to our current session.

```sh
[trinity@localhost ~]$ ulimit -a
core file size          (blocks, -c) 0
data seg size           (kbytes, -d) unlimited
scheduling priority             (-e) 0
file size               (blocks, -f) unlimited
pending signals                 (-i) 14959
max locked memory       (kbytes, -l) 64
max memory size         (kbytes, -m) unlimited
open files                      (-n) 1024
pipe size            (512 bytes, -p) 8
POSIX message queues     (bytes, -q) 819200
real-time priority              (-r) 0
stack size              (kbytes, -s) 8192
cpu time               (seconds, -t) unlimited
max user processes              (-u) 3
virtual memory          (kbytes, -v) unlimited
file locks                      (-x) unlimited

# To set our max user processes to 5000
[trinity@localhost ~]$ ulimit -u 5000
-bash: ulimit: max user processes: cannot modify limit: Operation not permitted
```

<br/>

### ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE

By default an User :

- can only lower his limits, not raise them
- the exception is where there are hard and sof limits : the user can raise the limit all the way up to the hard value, <ins><span style="color:#FF8A8A">**but only ONCE**</span></ins>. After the limit is raised, the next `ulimit` command can only lower it.

  It cannot be raised a 2nd time, even if the hard limit would allow it.
  
&nbsp;

###  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <ins>Manage User Privileges</ins>

Every time we had to make some important changes to the system, we used `sudo` in our commands : that command runs as if the root user executed it.


Users with this privilege can now do anything they want in the OS.

```sh
# How comes a user allowed to use sudo ? he must be a member of 'wheel' group
$ groups
cento wheel

# If not member, root user can add him into the group
$ sudo usermod -aG wheel cento
  sudo gpasswd -a cento wheel
```

<br/>

<ins><span style="color:#FF8A8A">**But what if we want a more fine tuned control ?**</span></ins>

There is a special file (**`/etc/sudoers`**) that defines who can use `sudo` and **under what conditions, what commands they can run and so on** <span style="color:#FF8A8A">**but we shouldn't edit this file directly**</span>. 

We use an utility called **`visudo`** that can check up our edits or correct to help us avoid mistakes in the file.

<br/>

Let's remove the User from the `wheel` group to make sure she can not use 'sudo' anymore and instead define a different sudo policy for him later.

```sh
$ sudo gpasswd -d cento wheel
Removing user cento from group wheel
```

<br/>

Let's start editing '/etc/sudoers' using `visudo` command :

- **%wheel** : represents any members of wheel group. In this 1st colum we define who the policy is for.

- **ALL=** : it is the **host**. Here we could specify that these rules only apply if our server's hostname or IP address has a specific value. Here, with ALL, we run as root.

- **(ALL)** : it is the **run as field**. Here we could type a list of usernames.

- **ALL** : it is the **list of commands** that can be excuted with sudo.
```sh
$ sudo visudo

## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands
#
# The syntax :
# user/group  hot=(run_as_user)     command_list
%wheel  ALL=(ALL)       ALL
```

<br>

#### üîñ <ins>Example</ins>

Let's define a policy for our User to let him :

- run **any `sudo`** command

```sh
cento  ALL=(ALL)       ALL
```

<br/>

- run any `sudo` command **as *trinity* and *john* user**

```sh
cento  ALL=(trinity,john)       ALL
```

<br/>

- run `sudo` command **to some specific commands**

```sh
cento  ALL=(ALL) /bin/ls, /bin/stat
```
```sh
cento  ALL= /bin/ls, /bin/stat
```
Result :
```sh
[cento@localhost ~]$ sudo echo $PATH
Sorry, user cento is not allowed to execute '/bin/echo /home/cento/.local/bin:/home/cento/bin:/opt/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/home/cento/.local/bin:/home/cento/bin' as root on localhost.localdomain.
```

<br/>

- run any `sudo` command **without providing password**

```sh
cento  ALL=       NOPASSWD:ALL
```

&nbsp;

###  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <ins>Manage access to the root account</ins>

Let's examine how to manage access to the root account in Linux.

```sh
# User with sudo privileges
$ sudo --login
  sudo -i

# Without privileges
$ su -
  su -l
  su --login
```

<br/>

Some systems might have the root account locked : **we can not do a regular login with password**.

```sh
# Only this command is allowed
$ sudo --login
```

If we want to allow people to log in as root with a password, 2 options :

- if root has no password, we set one : **`sudo passwd root`**
- if root has a password but is locked, we can unlock it : **`sudo passwd --unlock root`**

Then we can use :
```sh
$ su -
```

If we want to lock our root account :

```sh
$ sudo passwd --lock root
```

<span style="color:#FF8A8A">**Make sure to lock the rrot account if we have an user who can use sudo commands**</span>.

&nbsp;

###  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; üìΩÔ∏è <ins>Configure PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module)</ins>

When an User authenticates, he is allowed to do someting.

Actually not only people can authenticate but **programs can too** : if Program A needs confidential data from Program B, it needs to authenticate by providing some code. 

This is where **PAM** came into action. Some of them are already installed on CentOS. 

> You can for example enable authentication by USB stick with one of these modules.

We already have used **`su`** to authenticate as root.

```sh
$ ls /etc/pam.d/
atd               fingerprint-auth-ac     ksu               pluto         runuser-l          sssd-shadowutils  systemd-user
chfn              gdm-autologin           liveinst          polkit-1      setup              su                vlock
chsh              gdm-fingerprint         login             postlogin     smartcard-auth     sudo              vmtoolsd
config-util       gdm-launch-environment  other             postlogin-ac  smartcard-auth-ac  sudo-i            xserver
